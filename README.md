## About The Project

The De-Icing Comparison Experiment (D-ICE) was a radiometery evaluation campaign carried out on the North Slope of Alaska in 2017 and 2018. 
The objective was to assess the current state of ice-mitigation technology for observations made with broadband pyranometers and pyrgeometers. D-ICE
was led by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and conducted as a community effort through the Cold Climates Issues Working Group 
of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network, which operates under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization. Partners were from the international
community, incuding industry, government and academic institutions. The references section provides citations to data and project outcomes. This repository
archives CRBasic codes used to log the data from a series of four Campbell Scientific CR1000 data loggers (denoted #s 4, 5, 6, and 7).

## About The Project

The Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) was a polar icebreaker drift expedition during 2019 and 2020.
Assets deployed on ice by CU/CIRES and NOAA/PSL included a 10 m tower ~ 0.5 km from R/V Polarstern with access to line power and 3x Atmospheric 
Surface Flux Stations (ASFS) designed to mobility and autonomy in the MOSAiC "distributed network" 10-30 km from Polarstern. Details are provided
in Cox et al. (2023). CRBasic codes here ran data acquisition from Campbell Scientific CR1000X data loggers at each of the stations.
